# Orbiter is a simple and extendable PHP tool for publishing beautiful websites out of plain text documents


## Five Reasons to Use Orbiter

1. 	**Orbiter is not a CMS -- it doesn't have an admin panel and login screen**. It takes any folder with your articles and makes them available as a website or blog.

2. 	**Orbiter is extremely extensible**. With a plugin and hook system similar to WordPress you can customize and add support for any kind of document markup or templating engine. *Markdown* for markup and *Mustache* for templating are supported by default.

3. 	**Combines the best of static and dymanic site generators**. Runs on any server with PHP. Use either SSH, FTP, Git, Rsync or Dropbox for storing and syncronizing the source files.

4. 	**Doesn't enforce any workflow or tools for content management**. Keep using tools and methods you already know and can rely on. 

5. 	**Generates an RSS feed, XML sitemap and a 404 page automatically**. And uses standard `INI` files for configuration and supports `INI` syntax in the _front matter_ of your documents.


## Why Orbiter

Orbiter is a follow-up project to **[Rover Editor](https://github.com/kasparsd/rover-editor)** -- a web based text editor with Markdown syntax highlighting that works on any device with a web browser. While Rover is used for creating and exploring, Orbiter is a messanger that delivers your creation to the world via the World Wide Web. The idea is that you are no longer required to use the same tool for composing _and_ publishing your work.
